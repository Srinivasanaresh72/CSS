        <h1> Welcome to Fascoon </h1>
        <p> We at Fascoon are passionate about education and it is our lifeâ€™s mission to revolutionize how we perceive it.<br/>
            We are taking some massive baby steps towards a brighter and better tomorrow and forcing the orthodox education system to change slowly if not suddenly.<br/>
            Education also means helping people to learn how to do things and encouraging them to think.<br/>
            It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It helps us build opinions and have points of view on things in life.
