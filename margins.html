    <h1> HTML </h1>
    <p> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.< br /><br />
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. </p>
